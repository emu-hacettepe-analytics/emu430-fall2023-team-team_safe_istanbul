# Project Topic

We will utilize three datasets provided by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.

The first dataset, titled **"Earthquake Scenario Analysis Results"**, contains the outcomes of analyses conducted based on a 7.5 Mw nighttime earthquake scenario.

The second dataset, **"Neighborhood-Based Building Numbers in 2017"**, comprises information on the number of buildings in Istanbul's neighborhoods. These buildings are categorized by their construction year and the number of floors.

The third dataset is **"Municipality Population in 2019"**, contains population of Istanbul by districts in 2019.

Our objective is to compile a comprehensive report and identify the districts in Istanbul that are most susceptible to potential earthquakes. We aim to create an ordered priority list for neighborhoods and develop a risk map for Istanbul, taking geographical coordinates into account.
