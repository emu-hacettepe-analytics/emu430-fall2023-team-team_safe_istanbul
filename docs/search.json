These buildings are categorized by their construction year and the number of floors.\nThe third dataset is “Municipality Population in 2019”, contains population of Istanbul by districts in 2019.\nOur objective is to compile a comprehensive report and identify the districts in Istanbul that are most susceptible to potential earthquakes. We aim to create an ordered priority list for neighborhoods and develop a risk map for Istanbul, taking geographical coordinates into account.\n\n\nData Set\n\nEarthquake Scenario Analysis Results\nNeighborhood-Based Building Numbers in 2017\nMunicipality Population in 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
